Game content (unit profiles, weapon statistics, faction data, abilities, and point costs)
is **not** included in this repository. It is loaded at runtime from **operator-supplied
sources** (for example, a local clone of the BSData community data files). The developer
of this software never distributes GW content and takes no responsibility for how
operators source or use game data.

## BSData

[BSData](https://github.com/BSData) is an independent, community-maintained project. It
is not affiliated with or endorsed by Games Workshop. Operators who choose to use BSData
files do so under the terms of that project. This software provides an adapter to load
BSData XML files — it does not bundle or distribute those files.
