# CLAUDE.md — ListBuilder (Meta List Builder)

> Read SOUL.md first. Every decision here flows from it.

## What This App Is

ListBuilder is a smart army list builder for Warhammer 40K where every unit carries a live performance rating derived from real GT+ tournament data. As you build a list, it surfaces higher-rated alternatives at the same points cost. Ratings update as new event data comes in and reset when GW releases a new balance dataslate or codex.

|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Bundler | Vite |
| Test Runner | Vitest |
| API | tRPC + Zod |
| UI | React + Tailwind + shadcn |

## Data Sources

### Unit Profiles: BSData (via GameContentAdapter)
The platform ships **zero GW content**. Unit profiles are loaded at runtime from the operator's local BSData clone via `BSDataAdapter`. No unit data is stored in the DB.

```
BSDATA_DIR=/path/to/bsdata-clone/wh40k-10e
```

If `BSDATA_DIR` is not set, `NullAdapter` is used and unit searches return empty arrays. Shared adapter pattern with `apps/versus` — same `GameContentAdapter` interface.

### Ratings: Native match records + imported tournament data
Ratings are derived entirely from match data generated by users of this instance:

- **Native match records** — games tracked in `apps/game-tracker` with `is_tournament = 1`
- **Imported tournament results** — external CSV files the operator imports via the admin panel
  (BCP export, Tabletop Admiral export, or the platform's generic CSV format)
- No BCP scraping. The operator obtains external data themselves and imports it.
- Ratings reset on dataslate/codex — `meta_window` label changes and a fresh window begins

---

## Database Schema

No `units` table. Unit data lives in memory via `GameContentAdapter`.
`unit_content_id` columns are plain TEXT — no FK into game content.
`unit_name` and `unit_points` are denormalized at add-time.

```typescript
// unit_ratings  (derived from native + imported match data)
id               TEXT PRIMARY KEY
unit_content_id  TEXT NOT NULL      -- content adapter ID — NOT a DB FK
rating           TEXT NOT NULL      -- S / A / B / C / D
win_contrib      REAL NOT NULL
pts_eff          REAL NOT NULL
meta_window      TEXT NOT NULL      -- e.g. "2025-Q2" — resets on dataslate
computed_at      INTEGER NOT NULL

// lists
id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY
user_id    TEXT NOT NULL
faction    TEXT NOT NULL      -- user-entered string
name       TEXT NOT NULL
total_pts  INTEGER NOT NULL
created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL

// list_units
id               TEXT PRIMARY KEY
list_id          TEXT NOT NULL      -- references lists.id
unit_content_id  TEXT NOT NULL      -- content adapter ID — NOT a DB FK
unit_name        TEXT NOT NULL      -- denormalized at add-time
unit_points      INTEGER NOT NULL   -- denormalized at add-time
count            INTEGER NOT NULL
```

## tRPC Routers

```typescript
// Units
unit.search({ faction?, query? })          → unit[]
unit.get(id)                               → unit + rating

// Ratings
rating.get(unitId)                         → { rating, winContrib, ptsEff }
rating.alternatives({ unitId, ptsRange? }) → unit[]  -- same role, sorted by rating

// Lists
list.create({ faction, name })             → list
list.get(id)                               → list + all units + ratings
list.list()                                → list[]
list.addUnit({ listId, unitId, count? })
list.removeUnit({ listId, unitId })
list.delete(id)
```

---

## Rating System

Ratings are letter grades: **S, A, B, C, D**

Computed from:
- **Win-rate contribution**: how much does including this unit correlate with winning GT events
- **Points efficiency**: performance per point spent

Suggestions surface when you add a unit:
```
You added: Redemptor Dreadnought  85pts  Rating: C+
Suggestion: Brutalis Dreadnought  90pts  Rating: A-
            (+5pts, significantly stronger in the current meta)
```

Ratings reset to null when a new balance dataslate or codex drops. The meta window label (e.g. `"2025-Q2"`) changes and the BCP scraper starts a fresh accumulation from that point.

---

## User Flow

```
Login
  → Select faction
  → Browse units with ratings visible
  → Add unit to list
    → See live points total
    → See suggestion if a higher-rated option exists at similar cost
  → Save list
  → Export (text format for BCP / tournament submission)
```

## UI Notes

Same design tokens as the platform (slate-950 background, amber-400 accent, Geist).

Rating badge:
```
[ A- ]  ← green for S/A, amber for B/C, red for D
```

Unit card:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Brutalis Dreadnought        [ A- ] │
│  90pts  ·  Space Marines            │
│  T10  Sv2+  W12  ·  Melee          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Rules for Every Session

- Plan before touching anything — understand every layer first.
- No features that aren't needed yet.
- Ratings must be derived correctly. Test the scoring logic.
- Keep the stack shallow. Don't add layers.
- Stop when it works. Don't polish what doesn't need polishing.

---

## Testing: TDD Required

Tests before code. No exceptions.

```
src/
  lib/
    ratings/
      score.ts
      score.test.ts
```

BSData parsing lives in `packages/game-content` — do not duplicate it here.
There is no BCP scraper. Rating data comes from imported CSVs processed by the platform.
