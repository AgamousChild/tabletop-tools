# Data Sources

This document describes every external data source used or referenced by the platform,
what each source is for, who maintains it, and its legal status.

---

## Unit Profiles: BSData

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| What it is | Community-maintained Warhammer 40K army data files (`.cat`, `.gst` XML) |
| Who maintains it | [BSData](https://github.com/BSData) — independent volunteer community |
| GW affiliation | None — not affiliated with or endorsed by Games Workshop |
| License | No formal license; maintained as a community resource |
| How it's used | Operators load their own local BSData clone at server startup via `BSDATA_DIR` env var. The platform ships an adapter (`BSDataAdapter`) that parses XML into `UnitProfile` objects in memory. No GW content is stored in the platform database or shipped with this codebase. |
| Developer responsibility | None. The developer ships a parser only. Operators source and load the data themselves. |

**How to use it:**
1. Clone [BSData/wh40k-10e](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-10e) locally
2. Set `BSDATA_DIR=/path/to/your/clone` in your server environment
3. The server loads unit data into memory on startup

## Army Lists: User-Provided Text

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| What it is | Army list text pasted by users (BattleScribe/New Recruit export format) |
| Who maintains it | The user — it is their own list |
| GW affiliation | Lists contain GW faction/unit names; those names belong to GW |
| How it's used | Stored verbatim as plain text. Never parsed for GW content by the platform. The platform treats it as an opaque string. |
| Developer responsibility | None. The platform stores user-submitted text as submitted. |

## Match & Tournament Ratings: Native Match Records

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| What it is | Win/loss data generated by users playing games tracked in this platform |
| Who maintains it | Users of the instance — derived entirely from their own game records |
| GW affiliation | None — these are performance statistics, not GW content |
| How it's used | Unit win-rate contributions and points efficiency scores are computed from match records stored in the `matches` and `turns` tables. Unit references use `unit_content_id` (a plain TEXT column) resolved against the content adapter — never stored as GW-owned data. |

---

## Imported Tournament Results

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| What it is | External tournament result data imported by the operator in CSV format |
| Who maintains it | External tournament platforms (BCP, Tabletop Admiral, etc.) |
| GW affiliation | None in the data itself — faction names are user-entered strings |
| How it's used | Operators export data from external platforms and import it via the platform's admin import tool. The platform ships parsers for common CSV formats. How the operator obtains the export data is entirely their responsibility. |
| Developer responsibility | None. The platform accepts CSV files; it does not scrape any external service. |

**Supported import formats:**
- BCP results CSV export
- Tabletop Admiral CSV export
- Platform generic CSV (documented format)

## No Bundled GW Content

This codebase contains **zero** Games Workshop proprietary content. No unit names, no
faction names, no ability text, no point costs from GW publications appear anywhere in
this repository outside of illustrative examples in documentation comments within the
`packages/game-content` adapter code (which operators never ship as data).
